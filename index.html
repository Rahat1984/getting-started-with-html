<h1>Important Concepts</h1>

<b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>
   The web was invented in the early 90s. It is a collection of computers interconnected over a <em><a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/internet101/1.3"> WAN </a></em> that can communicate with each other. It contains roughly <b>30 billion documents</b>.
  <!-- RE: 'WAN' Just so I'm not copying Andy's description word for word --> 
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language.</b> It is made up of: 
  <br><em> Text content </em> - this is what you <b> see </b>
  <br><em>Markup</em> - This is what is <b>looks like</b>
  <br><em><a href="http://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/tags/"> Tags </em></a> - This tells the markup what to do, and helps to form <em><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp"> elements </em></a>
</p>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Programmers need to write code exactly how the computer understands otherwise the computer may well crash and/or fail to understand what has been inout. The programmer needs to write the correct <em><a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/syntax.html"> syntax </em></a>
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them, whereas inline elements do not begin on a new line when rendered visually.
